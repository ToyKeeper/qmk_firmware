ToyKeeper's Whitefox Layout
===========================

A relatively straightforward 65% "truefox" layout with some extras.

I often have to use muggle keyboards, can't use nice custom ones all the time,
so I try to keep my layout reasonably similar to common models so I won't trip
over muscle memory all the time when I go back and forth.

For example, most keyboards don't have dvorak built in, so I usually map that
in the host OS instead of doing it in the keyboard firmware.  The dvorak mode
here is mostly for the times when I connect to a computer which hasn't already
been remapped in software.

* Standard Truefox / Happy Hacking layout...
  * Backspace area split into two keys: backslash/pipe and tilde/grave
  * Backspace on qwerty row instead of backslash
  * Escape where tilde/grave normally is
* CapsLock is Control
* Space Cadet Shift keys double as ( and ) keys
* Right edge is Fn2, PageUp, PageDn, End, RightArrow.  Because I press End more
  than Home.
  (many 65% layouts use Delete, Home, PageUp, PageDn, RightArrow)
* Ctrl next to arrows, since I use Ctrl-Arrows a lot to change desktops.
* Can switch between qwerty and dvorak.  Qwerty is default, even though I only
  really use dvorak... because I usually remap that in software.  Also because
  it's easier for non-enthusiasts.
* Fn1 and Fn2 keys in lower left and upper right corners.

The Fn layers provide some extras.  Both layers share some things in common...

* F1-F12 along top row
* Arrows replaced by common PageUp/PageDn/Home/End keys
* Three app launch keys on the right side
* Delete instead of Backspace

Things exclusive to the Fn1 layer are...

* Mouse keys on the right hand
* Mouse buttons on the left hand, for quick easy X11 paste
* Media player controls -- play/pause, next, prev
* Eject instead of Escape
* Two sets of macro record/playback keys

Fn2 exclusive functions are...

* A quick easy way to press Shift+Insert (for pasting text into a terminal)
* Left-handed mouse keys (might remove later)
* Access to a few more keys not included in other layers:
  * Insert
  * CapsLock key, in case you ever need it
  * Right GUI and Menu keys
  * Reset / reflash firmware key
* Configure keyboard settings:
  * Switch main layer between qwerty and dvorak
  * Toggle NKRO
  * Some keys are reserved for lighting controls, but aren't used in this layout because my Whitefox has no LEDs
  * Also leaves room for configuring features on other similar keyboards...  like on a Massdrop Alt I'll add keys to swap BackSpace and BackSlash
